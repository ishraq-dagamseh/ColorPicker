# ColorPicker
In this project, I made two editions with some improvements.
First edition called: (colorPicker) file, I use a special input type, that called:"color", that allows the user to choose a color.

## IDE
In this project I used Vscode IDE to write html code with live server to show the results.

## website Interface
